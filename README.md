This project was created as part of Alura's TypeScript course. It's a simple cronometer built with React, showcasing concepts such as props, state, componentization, and hooks like useState and useEffect.

## Getting Started

To run the project, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the application.

## Features

- Start, pause, and reset the cronometer.
- Lap time tracking.
- Clear lap times and reset the cronometer.

## Componentization

The project is divided into several components:

- `App`: responsible for the application state and behavior.
- `Timer`: displays the current time and controls the cronometer.
- `LapTimes`: displays the lap times recorded by the cronometer.
